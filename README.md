# Basic-Python-Web-Script
This is not a Tool, this is used when someone is writing a tool for web pentest(or any other thing) this script will help him get started and u can add things according to your tool

##Usage:

`python3 setup.py`

`python3 tool.py -u https://example.com`

This Tool will list basic info like: IP, Hostname, Status code etc, But mainly it will validate URL that user has entered

Feel free to use in your personel projects...

##Cross Platform Support:

Unfortunately you can run this script on any OS but setup.py works with linux only, either way its useful because you can write your own setup.py or download manually etc
